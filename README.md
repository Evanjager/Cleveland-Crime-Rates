# Cleveland-Crime-Rates

I want to examine Lebron James and his impact on the Cleveland Cavaliers NBA team.

In addition to this, I want to dive a little deeper and see if:
1. was there any correlation between the Cavilers success and lowering Cleveland's crime rate
2. was there any correlation with the Cavilers Playoff years and lowering Cleveland's crime rate
3. was there any correlation between a figurehead like  Lebron James and lowering Cleveland crime rate
